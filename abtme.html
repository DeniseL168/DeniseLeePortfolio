                                <p>Ever since I could remember, I wanted to be a neurosurgeon. I started programming in 7th grade which is whhen I gained a passion for STEM. In a pursue of passion, I formed my school's first elitle AWS DeepRacer team, SHARP, and started the South Hills Robotics Club. Even though I love programming and coding, my dream to be a neurosurgeon has never faded. I am an active member of HOSA, a organization where students can show their passion in health and medicine. I strive to pursue my dreams while helping others and have fun! I am the VP of DreamMakers, a dream team that helps students build passion projects and earn volunteer hours and the captain of my school's JV basketball team.  I compete nationally in both dance and taekwondo, and I've been on Varisty Girls Basketball since Freshmen year. I won KAR Nationals for my dance solo and was titled Ms. Teen Dance of America. I was awarded Key Club's Member of the Year in our divison for my dedication and commitment. Not only do I excel in extracurricular activities, but I also excell academically. With my amazing time management skills, I've took on 5 APs my freshmen year, and I am currently enrolled in 4 this year. I spend most of my time listening to music and actively improving my skills. In the near future, I hope to attend my dream college, USC, pre-majoring in Computer Engineering in the Medical program. </p>
